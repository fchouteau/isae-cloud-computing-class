## 1. My first "Virtual Machine": GitHub Codespaces

First, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. You should already have one, otherwise create one.

### Intro to GitHub Codespaces

* [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a managed VM that lets you develop without configuring your local environment.
* Compared to configuring a VM yourself, Codespaces comes pre-loaded with developer tools, making it faster to get started.
* You have a free tier of 60 CPU hours / months and some disk space
* You pay for the CPU when the VM is ON and for the disk when the codespace is created

Have a look at the overview: [https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)

!!! question
    Can you describe it in your own words?
    How would ChatGPT (or any LLM) describe it?

!!! note
    Google Cloud has a similar service called Google Cloud Shell, but Codespaces is more powerful, so we will use that instead

??? info "How Codespaces work under the hood"
    **What is a Codespace technically?**

    A Codespace is a **Linux VM** running in Microsoft Azure (GitHub's parent company). When you create a Codespace:

    1. Azure provisions a VM with your chosen resources (CPU cores, RAM)
    2. A **Docker container** is started on that VM with your development environment
    3. The container is configured via a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in your repo

    **How does the browser connection work?**

    When you open a Codespace in your browser:

    - Your browser connects to a **VS Code Server** running in the container
    - The VS Code UI is rendered locally in your browser (it's a web app)
    - Commands and file operations are sent to the remote server via WebSocket

    **How does port forwarding work?**

    When you run a server (e.g., Jupyter on port 8888):

    1. The server binds to a port inside the container
    2. GitHub's infrastructure creates a **reverse proxy** with a unique URL
    3. Your browser connects to `https://{codespace-name}-8888.app.github.dev`
    4. The proxy forwards traffic through secure tunnels to your container

    This is why you can access localhost services without any firewall configuration! 

### Web UI : Create your codespace and connect to it using the web interface

Go to [https://github.com/fchouteau/isae-cloud-computing-codespace](https://github.com/fchouteau/isae-cloud-computing-codespace)

![codespace](slides/static/img/codespacefchouteau.png)

* Click on the green "Code" button, then select "Create codespace on main"
* It should open a browser tab with VS Code
* Launch a terminal using the top menu (Terminal > New Terminal)

You should see a VS Code instance

![codespace](slides/static/img/codespacevscode.png)

!!! question
    Where is this running?

If you go to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), you should see your codespace running

![img.png](slides/static/img/codespace.png)


### Alternative: Connect from local VSCode

You can also connect to your Codespace from your local VSCode installation instead of using the browser.


**Prerequisites:**

- VSCode installed on your machine
- [GitHub Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) installed

**Steps: (via Web UI)**

![img.png](slides/static/img/codespace_local.png)

- Go to https://github.com/codespaces and click on "Open in VS Code Desktop"

**Steps: (via VSCode)**

1. Open VSCode locally
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Type "Codespaces: Create New Codespace"
4. Paste the following: `fchouteau/isae-cloud-computing-codespace`

To reconnect to an existing codespace:
1. Open VSCode locally
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Type "Codespaces: Connect to Codespace"
4. Select your running Codespace from the list

**Benefits of local VSCode:**

- Use your familiar keybindings and settings
- Better performance (native app vs browser)
- Access to all your local extensions
- Easier file transfers via drag-and-drop

**Note:** The Codespace still runs remotely - only the UI is local.

### Explore GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started)

Identify the following features in the interface:

- Code editor (VS Code)
- Terminal
- File explorer
- Debugging tools (breakpoints, console output)

Run these commands to get a feel for the "computer" behind the interface:

* Check available disk space

??? note "Bash command to run"
    `df -h`

* Check the OS name

??? note "Bash command to run"
    `cat /etc/os-release`

* Check the CPU model

??? note "Bash command to run"
    `cat /proc/cpuinfo`

* This is the hardware model... How many cores do you have available? How much RAM?

??? note "Help"
    `htop` will give you your current usage and available cores, or you can do `nproc`

* Check the python installation

??? note "Bash command to run"
    `python --version`
    `pip list`

* Try and upload a file from your computer to the codespace by right clicking on the file explorer on the left

* Create a new file and write a simple python "Hello World", then execute it from the terminal

### Understanding Ports and Port Forwarding

??? info "What is a port?"
    A **port** is a 16-bit number (0-65535) that identifies a specific process or service on a machine. Think of it like apartment numbers in a building:

    - The IP address is the building address
    - The port is the apartment number

    **Common ports:**

    | Port | Service |
    |------|---------|
    | 22 | SSH |
    | 80 | HTTP (web) |
    | 443 | HTTPS (secure web) |
    | 8888 | Jupyter (default) |
    | 8501 | Streamlit (default) |

    When you run `jupyter lab`, it starts a web server listening on port 8888. Anyone who can reach that port can access Jupyter.

??? info "What is port forwarding?"
    **Port forwarding** (or tunneling) connects a port on one machine to a port on another through a secure channel.

    ```
    Your laptop:8888  <--tunnel-->  Remote VM:8888
    ```

    When you access `localhost:8888` on your laptop, the traffic is forwarded through the tunnel to port 8888 on the remote machine.

    **Why is this useful?**

    - The remote machine might not be directly accessible from the internet
    - You want to access services as if they were running locally
    - Security: the tunnel encrypts traffic

### A demo of codespace port forwarding / web preview

* In your codespace, run `jupyter lab` to launch Jupyter Lab
* Check the "Ports" tab in VS Code: it should show a new entry for port 8888. If not, add it manually
* Click "Open in Browser"
* Copy the token from your terminal to the browser
* You are now in a Jupyter Lab instance hosted on your GitHub Codespace VM!

!!! question
    How do you think this works? Try to describe it in your own words.

* Cancel the Jupyter process with `CTRL+C`

To learn more about port forwarding in codespaces, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace)

!!! success "What you learned in this section"
    - **Remote development environments**: Codespaces provide a cloud-hosted VM with pre-configured tools
    - **VS Code in the browser**: The same IDE experience, but running remotely
    - **Port forwarding**: Access services running on remote machines as if they were local
    - **System exploration**: Commands like `df -h`, `htop`, `cat /proc/cpuinfo` to understand your environment

## 2. Running a ML training script in the Codespace

In this section, you will run a machine learning training script directly in your Codespace. This demonstrates **remote computation**: the training runs on the Codespace VM, not on your laptop.

### 2.1. Locate the training script

In your Codespace file explorer, navigate to the `training/` folder. You should see a `training.py` script.

Take a look at the code:

```bash
cat training/training.py
```

!!! question
    What does this script do? What model is it training? What dataset does it use?

### 2.2. Install dependencies and run the training

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

Then run the training script:

```bash
python training/training.py --epochs 2 --save-model
```

!!! question "Think about it"
    **Where is this training actually running?**

    - On your laptop?
    - On the Codespace VM (in the cloud)?
    - Somewhere else?

    How can you verify this? (Hint: check CPU usage with `htop` in another terminal)

Watch the training progress. The script will save a model file (e.g., `model.pth`) when complete.

### 2.3. Download the trained model to your laptop

Once training is complete, you need to retrieve the model file to your local machine.

**Option A: Via the file explorer**

- Right-click on the `mnist_cnn.pt` file in the VS Code file explorer
- Select "Download"

**Option B: Via the terminal (if you have `gh` CLI locally)**

```bash
# From your local machine terminal
gh codespace cp remote:/workspaces/isae-cloud-computing-codespace/training/model.pth ./model.pth
```

!!! success "Checkpoint"
    You have successfully:

    - [x] Run a training script on a remote machine (Codespace)
    - [x] Downloaded the resulting model to your laptop

    This is the fundamental workflow of **remote computation**: run heavy tasks in the cloud, retrieve results locally.

!!! question
    How comfortable do you feel with this remote machine? Is it easy to get data in or out? Code in or out?

!!! success "What you learned in this section"
    - **Remote computation**: Running code on a cloud machine instead of your laptop
    - **File transfer**: Moving files between local and remote environments
    - **The cloud workflow**: Edit locally (or remotely), run remotely, retrieve results

## 3. (Optional) Building a webapp

!!! note "Preview for Day 2"
    This section is a **preview** of what you'll do in Day 2 when we cover **deployment**.

    It's useful to do now because it lets you explore:

    - **Port forwarding**: How to access a web app running on a remote machine from your browser
    - **Web app deployment basics**: Running a server and exposing it to users

    If you're short on time, you can skip this section and come back to it later.

We will introduce **Streamlit**, a Python library to build quick web apps for data science.

In this section, you will build your first interactive webapp in Python and preview it using Codespace's port forwarding feature.

First, watch this video:

</video>

Then, take a look at an [introduction to Streamlit](https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/introduction-to-streamlit) and [the Streamlit application gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery)

!!! question
    Can you describe what Streamlit is?
    Can you think of ways it could be useful to you?

### 3.1. Your first Streamlit application

Take a look at the code below: 

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_image_comparison import image_comparison
import cv2

st.set_page_config("Webb Space Telescope vs Hubble Telescope", "🔭")

st.header("🔭 J. Webb Space Telescope vs Hubble Telescope")

st.write("")
"This is a reproduction of the fantastic [WebbCompare](https://www.webbcompare.com/index.html) app by [John Christensen](https://twitter.com/JohnnyC1423). It's built in Streamlit and takes only 10 lines of Python code. If you like this app, please star [John's original repo](https://github.com/JohnEdChristensen/WebbCompare)!"
st.write("")

st.markdown("### Southern Nebula")
image_comparison(
    img1="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/hubble/southern_nebula_700.jpg",
    img2="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/webb/southern_nebula_700.jpg",
    label1="Hubble",
    label2="Webb",
)


st.markdown("### Galaxy Cluster SMACS 0723")
image_comparison(
    img1="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/hubble/deep_field_700.jpg",
    img2="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/webb/deep_field_700.jpg",
    label1="Hubble",
    label2="Webb",
)

st.markdown("### Carina Nebula")
image_comparison(
    img1="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/hubble/carina_2800.png",
    img2="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/webb/carina_2800.jpg",
    label1="Hubble",
    label2="Webb",
)

st.markdown("### Stephan's Quintet")
image_comparison(
    img1="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/hubble/stephans_quintet_2800.jpg",
    img2="https://www.webbcompare.com/img/webb/stephans_quintet_2800.jpg",
    label1="Hubble",
    label2="Webb",
)
```

!!! question
    By reading the code and documentation, can you describe what this code does?

### 3.2. Running Streamlit in the Codespace

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python-headless streamlit-image-comparison
```

Create a file `streamlit_jswt.py` and copy/paste the code above.

Run the Streamlit server:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_jswt.py
```

This will launch the application on **port 8501** of your Codespace.

**To view it:**

1. Check the "Ports" tab in VS Code (bottom panel)
2. You should see port 8501 listed
3. Click "Open in Browser" or hover and click the globe icon

!!! question "Understanding port forwarding"
    The Streamlit server is running on the Codespace VM, not on your laptop.

    Yet you can see it in your browser. How is this possible?

    **Answer:** Codespace automatically creates a tunnel (port forward) from the remote port 8501 to a public URL that your browser can access.

Once you're done exploring, quit the server with `CTRL+C`.

!!! success "What you learned"
    - **Port forwarding**: Accessing a remote service through a tunnel
    - **Web app basics**: A Python process serving HTTP on a port
    - **Deployment preview**: In Day 2, you'll deploy apps like this to the cloud

## What's Next

In Session 2, you'll learn how to **package applications using Docker** so they can run anywhere.

In Day 2, you'll combine these skills to deploy ML models to the cloud.
