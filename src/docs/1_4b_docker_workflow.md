## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Understand Dockerfile structure** - Read and explain what each instruction in a Dockerfile does
2. **Build Docker images** - Use `docker build` with proper tagging conventions for a container registry
3. **Push/Pull from a registry** - Authenticate to Google Artifact Registry and exchange images with teammates
4. **Run containers with configuration** - Map ports, set environment variables, and understand container lifecycle

!!! warning
    Please read all the text in the question before executing the step-by-step instructions because there might be help or indications after the instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you should have:

- Set up your GitHub Codespace (from the [previous session](1_2d_handson_gcp.md))
- Installed and configured the `gcloud` CLI (from the [previous session](1_2d_handson_gcp.md))
- Manipulated Google Cloud Storage in the previous session

!!! tip
    Use Google Chrome without any ad blockers if you have any issues, or use the local VSCode + Codespace extension.
    If you have connectivity issues, switch your wi-fi connection between eduroam (preferred), isae-edu, or a 4G hotspot.

## Team Setup

You should be in teams of 2-5 people.

Each team member picks a different mascot and remembers it:

* 🐈 cat
* 🐕 dog
* 👽 yoda
* 🦉 owl
* 🐼 panda

Find a **group name** for your team - you will need it for tagging your images.

!!! info "Shared Container Registry"
    A container registry has been pre-created for this workshop. You will push and pull images from:

    ```
    europe-docker.pkg.dev/isae-sdd-481407/isae-sdd-de-2526-docker
    ```

## Phase 1: BUILD

### 1.1 - Start Development Environment (GitHub Codespace)

Launch your GitHub Codespace from the preconfigured repository: [https://github.com/fchouteau/isae-cloud-computing-codespace](https://github.com/fchouteau/isae-cloud-computing-codespace)

Ensure that the `gcloud` CLI is installed and configured (run `gcloud init` like [last time](1_2d_handson_gcp.md#3-install-google-cloud-sdk-configure-the-shell)).

### 1.2 - Get Resources from Google Cloud Storage

From your GitHub Codespace, download your mascot resources. First, set your mascot:

```bash
export MASCOT=<your chosen mascot>  # cat, dog, owl, panda, or yoda
```

**Only download your mascot** (no cheating - this will cause confusion later!)

```bash
gsutil -m cp -r gs://fchouteau-isae-cloud/be/${MASCOT} .
cd ${MASCOT}
```

You should see a file structure like this:

```text
yoda/
├── app.py
├── AUTHOR.txt
├── Dockerfile
├── favicon.ico
├── imgs
│   ├── 1.gif
│   ├── 2.gif
│   ├── 3.gif
│   ├── 4.gif
│   └── 5.gif
└── template.html.jinja2

```

### 1.3 - Build your Docker image

!!! question
    * Look at the `Dockerfile` (`cat Dockerfile`), what does each instruction do?
    * Look at `app.py` (`cat app.py`). What is Flask? What does this app do?

**Edit the file `AUTHOR.txt`** to add your name instead of the placeholder.

!!! danger
    On which port is your Flask app running? (check the `Dockerfile`)
    Note it carefully - you will need to communicate it to your teammates!

**Set your group name and build the image:**

```bash
export GROUPNAME=<your team name>

docker build -t europe-docker.pkg.dev/isae-sdd-481407/isae-sdd-de-2526-docker/${GROUPNAME}-${MASCOT}:1.0 .
```

Verify with `docker images` - you should see your image listed.

!!! question
    Describe concisely to your past self what is a `Docker Image`

!!! success "Checkpoint"
    Wait for instructor confirmation that everyone has built their image before moving to the SHIP phase.

## Phase 2: SHIP

### 2.1 - Authenticate to the Container Registry

Configure Docker to authenticate with Google Artifact Registry:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker europe-docker.pkg.dev
```

### 2.2 - Push your Docker image

Push your image to the shared registry:

```bash
docker push europe-docker.pkg.dev/isae-sdd-481407/isae-sdd-de-2526-docker/${GROUPNAME}-${MASCOT}:1.0
```

!!! question
    What is a Container Registry? Why not just share Dockerfiles instead of images?

??? answer
    Pre-built images ensure consistency across environments, faster deployment (no build step needed), and no build dependencies required on the target machine.

### 2.3 - Communicate with your team

Share with your teammates:

- Your **image name** (e.g., `team1-yoda:1.0`)
- Your **port number** (from your Dockerfile)

!!! success "Checkpoint"
    Wait for instructor confirmation that all images are pushed before moving to the RUN phase.

## Phase 3: RUN

### 3.1 - Pull your teammate's image

Get the image name and port number from one of your teammates, then pull their image:

```bash
export TEAMMATE_MASCOT=<teammate's mascot>

docker pull europe-docker.pkg.dev/isae-sdd-481407/isae-sdd-de-2526-docker/${GROUPNAME}-${TEAMMATE_MASCOT}:1.0
```

Verify with `docker images` - you should see your teammate's image.

### 3.2 - Run the container

Run your teammate's container with port mapping and your name as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:<TEAMMATE_PORT> -e USER="<your name>" \
  europe-docker.pkg.dev/isae-sdd-481407/isae-sdd-de-2526-docker/${GROUPNAME}-${TEAMMATE_MASCOT}:1.0
```

Replace `<TEAMMATE_PORT>` with the port number your teammate told you (from their Dockerfile).

### 3.3 - Access via Codespace Port Forwarding

1. Open the **"Ports"** tab in VS Code (bottom panel)
2. Port 8080 should appear automatically when the container starts
3. Click the **globe icon** or **"Open in Browser"** to access the webapp

!!! tip
    You can also publicly share the Codespace preview link so that other people can see your results.

### 3.4 - Container Management

Useful commands to manage your containers:

```bash
docker ps          # See running containers
docker logs <id>   # Check logs if issues
docker stop <id>   # Stop a container
```

## Success Criteria

Your running webapp must show:

| Checkpoint | What it proves |
|------------|----------------|
| Displays teammate's mascot (not your own) | You pulled the correct image |
| Shows author name (teammate's name) | Image was built by your teammate |
| Shows your name | You configured the USER env var at runtime |

!!! bug
    If any of the three items above are missing, use the troubleshooting guide below!

### Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Wrong mascot | Pulled wrong image | Check image name, repull |
| Author shows placeholder | Teammate forgot AUTHOR.txt | Teammate rebuilds & repushes |
| Your name missing | Forgot `-e USER=...` | Stop container, rerun with env var |
| Page not loading | Wrong port mapping | Check teammate's port, fix `-p` flag |

!!! example
    Try to refresh the webpage to make more gifs appear!

**Share your result on Slack**

## What's Next?

You've successfully built, shipped, and run Docker containers. But consider these limitations:

| Limitation | Why it matters |
|------------|----------------|
| Only accessible via your Codespace | No public URL - others can't see your app |
| Ephemeral | When Codespace stops, container dies |
| No scaling | One container handles all requests |
| Manual process | You ran `docker run` by hand |

!!! info "Coming up: Deployment"
    In the Deployment session, we'll solve these problems: deploy containers to real cloud infrastructure with public URLs, automatic restarts, and managed scaling.

## Cleanup

Stop and remove your containers (optional but good practice):

```bash
# Stop running containers
docker ps -q | xargs -r docker stop

# Remove containers
docker ps -aq | xargs -r docker rm

# (Optional) Remove local images
docker images -q | xargs -r docker rmi
```

!!! note
    Codespaces are ephemeral, so cleanup is optional. Everything will be removed when the Codespace is deleted.

## Congratulations!

!!! success
    You have successfully completed the Build-Ship-Run workflow! You now understand the fundamental Docker concepts that power modern application deployment.
